## Description
Globally, card processing fees typically cost merchants between 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction, including minimum transaction fees that limit the viability of small payments. This sliding percentage fee is also based on transaction throughput with smaller merchants paying the highest fees. Enter PePay, the mobile-first crypto to fiat payment app that executes payments seamlessly, and at a fraction of the cost discussed above.

PePay features biometric payment security, NFC linked payments, secure p2p comms, 4337 enhanced UX, daily spend allowance limits as well as low/no cost off-ramping.
